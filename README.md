# Sphere volume: Monte Carlo method
The project is a visualisation of a vague way to calculate the volume of a sphere using the Monte Carlo method

For a better understanding of how the Monte Carlo method works to calculate the volume of a sphere and also help others to understand it at all (without the use of any complicated maths), this small project was created.

With the simple UI you can easily add n new points to the diagram and the software automatically calculates the new value of K/n (which is the sphere's volume).
The program uses one eighth of a sphere with a radius of 1 for better demonstration purposes.
